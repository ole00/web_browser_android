# web_browser_android
Minimalistic Android web browser that uses WebView as the rendering engine.

This android web browser tries to be as minimal (and simple) as possible while still having some essential features:
* tabbed browsing (preserving the opened tabs upon restarts)
* simple bookmark list (with export and import feature)
* browsing navigation history (saved upon exit)
* opening links in new tab (via context menu)
* option to save files to downloads directory (via context menu)
* blocking extensive page loadings (via settings menu)
* font size changes
* blocking screen zooming
* full-screen for video playback (youtube in browser)
* conceal-able tool bar to maximise screen estate (via tapping the browser icon)

The browser is very light-weight therefore can be used with old and slow devices. It does not do any tracking on its own and does not snoop on your browsing activities. 

The source code is quite minimal so you can check how certain WebView and web browsing features can be implemented.
